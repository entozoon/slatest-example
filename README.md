# Slatest Example

An exemplary exampular example of the Shopify theme development toolkit [Slatest](https://github.com/entozoon/slatest).

Please be aware that this may slip out of date with Slatest versions and structure, so refer to that package for your main source of guidance.

## What do I do?

    npm i
    npm start

## What else must I do?

You want to tailor `slatest.config.json` to your Shopify store's requirements. It should be straight forward, [see here for instructions](https://github.com/entozoon/slatest#usage).

## Where is the theme? Why are the folders empty?

There is no theme in this example, you'll have to load one in yourself. The directories are here to give you an idea of the structure.

If you are loading in a theme template, you need it to [upload the entire thing in one go](https://github.com/entozoon/slatest#deploying-entire-theme).
